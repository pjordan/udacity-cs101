#Define a procedure, total_enrollment,
#that takes as an input a list of elements,
#where each element is a list containing
#three elements: a university name,
#the total number of students enrollect,
#and the annual tuition.

#The procedure should return two numbers,
#not a string,
#giving the total number of students
#enrolled at all of the universities
#in the list, and the total tuition
#(which is the sum of the number
#of students enrolled times the
#tuition for each university).
